## Hello, my name is Richard Muri.

I am a computer engineer and perpetual student. I am fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software, where the abstract concept of code turns into a physical process. My favorite way to engage with technical subjects is to peek behind abstractions and try to form an intuition for how it works. Computer architecture in particular fascinates me for this reason. 

My past interests and topics of study include computer architecture, digital hardware security, embedded processing, digital signal processing, high-performance computing, and FPGA development. In 2019 I wrote my master's thesis, titled ["Processor-in-Memory Computer Architectures"](www.github.com).
